ATM Management System (Python)

Hey!
This is a simple ATM system made using Python, mainly to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It runs in the terminal and lets you do basic ATM operations like checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

This project is great for beginners or students who are learning Python OOP.

What Can You Do With It?

Using this program, you can:

Check how much money is in the account

Deposit money

Withdraw money (only if you have enough balance)

View account details

Exit the ATM

Everything works through a simple menu.

What I Practiced in This Project

This project helped me understand:

Abstract classes and abstract methods

Inheritance (parent and child classes)

Encapsulation (keeping balance private)

Method overriding

Class methods and static methods

Basically, most of the important OOP concepts in Python.

How the Code Works (Simple Explanation)

BankAccount acts like rules for bank accounts

Account stores name, account number, and balance

ATM does the real work like deposit, withdraw, and balance checking

The ATM class inherits everything it needs and adds actual ATM features.

How to Run It

Make sure Python 3 is installed

Save the file as atm.py

Open terminal or command prompt

Run:
